# IPL 2020 Batting – EDA & Power BI Dashboard

This repository is a small end-to-end project where I explore IPL 2020 batting stats using:

- A **Jupyter Notebook** for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- A **Power BI dashboard** to turn those insights into an interactive report

It’s mainly a learning / practice project for myself, but you’re welcome to use it as a reference or starting point.


##  Project Goals

- Get comfortable doing **EDA on real cricket data**
- Build intuition for **batting performance metrics** (runs, strike rate, boundaries, consistency, contribution, etc.)
- Practice turning raw stats into:
  - Cleaned, feature-rich data in Python
  - A simple, interactive dashboard in Power BI
 

##   What Happens in the Notebook

The notebook performs a concise end-to-end EDA on IPL 2020 batting data:

Import & load data using pandas and visualization libraries.

Initial inspection to understand structure, types, and missing values.

Data cleaning by removing irrelevant fields and preparing the dataset.

Player performance analysis including runs, 50s/100s, matches, and rankings.

Consistency & contribution metrics to evaluate reliability beyond total runs.

Boundary analysis covering 4s, 6s, and boundary percentage.

Strike rate & efficiency checks to identify high-impact scorers.

Derived metrics like boundary runs, runs per ball, and summary tables.

Visualizations to explore trends and relationships across key metrics.

Personal insights highlighting notable patterns and player impact.

##   Power BI Dashboard 

The Power BI file is built on the same IPL 2020 batting dataset.

It’s used to:

- Create an **interactive view** of batting performance
- Experiment with visuals like:
  - Bar / column charts for top scorers and boundary hitters
  - Cards for key KPIs (total runs, average, strike rate, etc.)
  - Filters / slicers by player, team, or match (depending on how you wire your data
